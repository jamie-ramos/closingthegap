"NOTE: Title IV institutions are those with a written agreement with the U.S. Department of Education that allows the institution to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. The four U.S. service academies that are not Title IV eligible are included in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) universe because they are federally funded and open to the public. Awards displayed in this table were conferred during the 12-month period July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. Because of changes to institutional characteristics between the reporting year (2017-18) and collection year (2018-19), institutions may report awards that are not consistent with their current levels of offering (e.g., 6 institutions that were less-than-2-year institutions in the collection year reported awarding 95 associate’s degrees in the reporting year). Awards to individuals who self-identify with more than one race are included in the Two or more races category. Individuals who are in the United States on a visa or temporary basis, and who are not authorized to remain indefinitely, are included in the Nonresident alien category regardless of race or ethnicity. Awards to individuals of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity are included in the Hispanic or Latino category regardless of race. Definitions for terms used in this table may be found in the IPEDS online glossary located at https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryAll.aspx.",,,,,,,,,,,
